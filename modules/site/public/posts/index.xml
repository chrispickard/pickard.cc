      <description>If you have multiple git identities (a personal and a work email, say) and would like to use both in different projects on the same machine it can be a hassle. Hopefully you&#39;ve never committed to your work repo with your personal email address! If this happens you&#39;re looking at an unwieldy git filter-branch invocation to fix it.
To avoid the issue in the future you can use a feature of git called conditional includes, but I still find them easy to forget to include in each repo that needs a different identity (and I don&#39;t use a separate ~/dev/work and ~/dev/personal so there isn&#39;t a good place to set and forget them).</description>
